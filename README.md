## Hi there 👋
I am a Java, Python, and Angular Fullstack developer and DevOps living in Paris. 
I use Spring Boot, Micronaut, and Flask as backend frameworks.
Mariadb PostgreSQL and MongoDB as database.

I am also a Rust fans. I hope to explore using Rust in different fields, including web development, DevOps, data science, AI, Quantum cryptography and embedded system, or just solve leetcode problems with Rust.

I often use Golang, mainly for web scraping.
