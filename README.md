## Hi there 👋
I am a Java, Python, and Angular Fullstack developer and DevOps living in Paris. 

I hold a Ph.D. in Physical Chemistry and a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.

I work daily on a personal passion project focused on cutting-edge quantum technologies:

### 🚀 [QuantumCryptLab.com](https://www.quantumcryptlab.com)  
A growing knowledge hub dedicated to:  
🧠 Quantum Computing ・ 🔬 Quantum Mechanics ・ 🔐 Quantum Cryptography ・ 🤖 Quantum Machine Learning  

> 🛠️ It's still in its early stages — but I'm building it every day.

---

I use Spring Boot, Micronaut, and Flask as backend frameworks.
Mariadb PostgreSQL and MongoDB as database.

I am also a Rust fans. I hope to explore using Rust in different fields, including web development, DevOps, data science, AI, Quantum cryptography and embedded system, or just solve leetcode problems with Rust.

I often use Golang, mainly for web scraping.
