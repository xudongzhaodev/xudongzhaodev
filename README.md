## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a Java, Python, and Angular Fullstack developer and DevOps living in Paris. 
I use Spring Boot, Micronaut, and Flask as backend frameworks.

I am also a Rust enthusiast. I hope to explore using Rust in different fields, including web development, DevOps, data science, AI, and embedded system.
